Unfortunately, we’re unable to grant you any additional cards with this
merchant for this reason. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.

This is not a set in stone restriction of Privacy Cards at Criterionchannel.
Once you’ve built up a little more history by settling transactions with other
merchants, we’ll be more than happy to take another look at your account and
grant an additional card for this merchant.

Moving forward, the best way to avoid this is to use one Merchant Card with
each merchant for all future purchases. If you're concerned about the card's
security, you can pause it between uses or set limits on it.
